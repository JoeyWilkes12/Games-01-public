Using Claude Opus 4.5 Thinking:
- Reason regarding the following potential enhancements:
- write your plan to [tasks.md](http://tasks.md/) or any other mechanism that you use

& write a thorough implementation plan while considering what you’d like to delegate to a Gemini 3 model, or GPT-OSS 120B (Medium); These are the models available there are 3 Gemini 3 models, 3 Claude Models & 1 GPT OSS model specifically: 
1) Gemini 3 Pro (High)
2) Gemini 3 Pro (Low)
3) Gemini 3 Flash
4) Claude Sonnet 4.5

Here are the primary modifications:

Cloning from `main` & others from the latest commits from this public repository: [https://github.com/JoeyWilkes12/Games-01-public](https://github.com/JoeyWilkes12/Games-01-public:)

branches to review & successfully merge with as much code as possible. : 

- `bank_game_01_claude_opus4.5_01` which became [**`v3.1.0_bank_base_functionality_UI`](https://github.com/JoeyWilkes12/Games-01-public/tree/v3.1.0_bank_base_functionality_UI), I believe**
- `dice_enhancements_03_gemini3_pro_high`
- `main`

You may write any concerns of lost code & challenges in merging to the `2026-01-09_20-52-55_dialogue_response.md` file inside `dialogues` folder. Write the file name, it’s full path, the lines of the issue, and a description. You may also put that into a `2026-01-09_20-52-55_dialogue_response.csv`.

Ideally this will become the new `main` branch as we will pull request this branch. The main functionality of the app is the primary concern then if we have any spare time to review playwright tests that please do so. prioritize modular, small tests over big demo recording tests. We want to be able to know the application is working.

You may complete these tasks either after completing the primary modifications or as you go if you anticipate not being able to complete everything in one-shot execution: 
- Upon completion of these modifications, write additional tests using seed & specific setting configurations. You can also review JSON other files associated with testing.
- Regarding new tests, always review the [run-all-tests.sh](http://run-all-tests.sh/) script to ensure it encapsulates all the latests tests & is the most broad & complete source for testing. 

- Update readmes & documentation.
- Before the end of your execution, commit changes locally.
It is vital that if for context purposes, you are unable to complete all of these tasks, always locally commit your changes, update the tasks for the future so you could pick up where you left off given additional execution time & context, and be explicit when reporting back to the user what the plan is for continuity.
