# Claude Opus 4.5 (Thinking)
- Reason regarding the following potential enhancements:
- write your plan to [tasks.md](http://tasks.md/) or any other mechanism that you use

& write a thorough implementation plan while considering what you’d like to delegate to a Gemini 3 model, or GPT-OSS 120B (Medium); These are the models available there are 3 Gemini 3 models, 3 Claude Models & 1 GPT OSS model specifically: 
1) Gemini 3 Pro (High)
2) Gemini 3 Pro (Low)
3) Gemini 3 Flash
4) Claude Sonnet 4.5

Here are the primary modifications:

- [ ]  add JSON import, export for configuration & settings just like in Random Event Dice using same UI pattern. Keep a “name” key in the JSON that doesn’t get used. The JSON also needs to have a seed key that’ll be used in testing. The JSON can also have determined game play when there are specific number of plays & seed, as well as specified number rounds so that the entire gameplay can be deterministic thus providing end to end gameplay test.
- [ ]  Provide additional documentation via markdowns that describe the logic that was implemented for the
- [ ]  We want the bank game play UI to be mobile friendly. What enhancements can be made.
- [ ]  In Bank, lets change the order & placement of some of the UI elements. Move the `Current Roller` element to be just above the `Roll Dice` button so that it’s always very clear who will be taking the action. Move the Survival statistic & Risk Per roll into a collapsible dashboard.
- [ ]  The `Banking enabled after 3 rolls` can go right above the `Select players to bank` element and the `Banking enabled after 3 rolls` can disappear after the 3rd roll since it’s no longer relevant.
- [ ]  Note that the `Select players to bank` element with multi-player select is fantastic & takes up lots of space. Can we have that entire element encapsulated into a dropdown or exposable element. Keep the `All` & `Clear` buttons as well.
- [ ]  We want to allow games as low as 1 round primary for testing purposes
- [ ]  If we have extra time, we also want to have a summary scoreboard (that is an alternative view to the entire scoreboard, where the most essential pieces of information are what is the score of the player who’s current turn it is, how many points would it take for this player to surpass the next player who has more points than them, as well as how many points it would take for this player to surpass player number one. As well as a ranking of players based on their placement in descending points, where the rank is repeated for players that are tied (so 2 people can have rank #1 if they both have the top score as a tie). We want this in the situation that there are dozens of players and so it’d be very impractical to have to show the entire scoreboard even on mobile. We want to empower the user to be in control of how much they want to see.
- [ ]  The `Dice Probabilities (2d6)` cheatsheet is also great, it just doesn’t need to say `Dice Probabilities (2d6)` on it until the user opens it up. It just have the sideways triangle & the statistics emoji/icon that it currently has. Fewer words is better for collapsible components.

Feel free to use playwright to open the browser to review how you see the app, to take screenshots and take very small recordings that you can also ingest & inform additional enhancements. 

You may complete these tasks either after completing the primary modifications or as you go if you anticipate not being able to complete everything in one-shot execution: 
- Upon completion of these modifications, write additional tests using seed & specific setting configurations. You can also review JSON other files associated with testing.
- Regarding new tests, always review the [run-all-tests.sh](http://run-all-tests.sh/) script to ensure it encapsulates all the latests tests & is the most broad & complete source for testing. 

- Update readmes & documentation.
- Before the end of your execution, commit changes locally.
It is vital that if for context purposes, you are unable to complete all of these tasks, always locally commit your changes, update the tasks for the future so you could pick up where you left off given additional execution time & context, and be explicit when reporting back to the user what the plan is for continuity.
