Claude Opus 4.5 (Thinking)
- Reason regarding the following potential enhancements:
- write your plan to [tasks.md](http://tasks.md/) or any other mechanism that you use & write a thorough implementation plan 
    

Here are the primary modifications:

- Bank, the cheatsheet icon should be bottom left, because when it’s in the top right (on mobile) it overlaps & obscures the settings button.
- In Bank, when the game completes there is a `Game Over!` completion screen that is shown. That completion panel should have a scrollable element in the case that there are lots of players. The Play Again button should be frozen at the top of the panel (above the scrollable element of the scoreboard). Also add margin to the top & bottom so that the full panel can be seen when accessing via mobile.
- Revisit these enhancements to see if they were completed fully. Review seed & unit tests & playwright tests. Enhance documentation, markdown files, include the parent [`readme.md`](http://readme.md) to include screenshot of Bank. Retake screenshots of the main views of the app for the main & associated readme's. Consider additional enhancements.

Feel free to use playwright to open the browser to review how you see the app, to take screenshots and take very small recordings that you can also ingest & inform additional enhancements. 

You may complete these tasks either after completing the primary modifications or as you go if you anticipate not being able to complete everything in one-shot execution: 
- Upon completion of these modifications, write additional tests using seed & specific setting configurations. You can also review JSON other files associated with testing.
- Regarding new tests, always review the [run-all-tests.sh](http://run-all-tests.sh/) script to ensure it encapsulates all the latests tests & is the most broad & complete source for testing. 

- Update readmes & documentation.
- Before the end of your execution, commit changes locally.
It is vital that if for context purposes, you are unable to complete all of these tasks, always locally commit your changes, update the tasks for the future so you could pick up where you left off given additional execution time & context, and be explicit when reporting back to the user what the plan is for continuity.
