Claude Opus 4.5 > Planning > 

You are a QA developer as well as the lead SWE on this project. You are returning after several junior developers have made changes. You want to review previous github branches & commits, especially pertaining to the `Random Event Dice` game which seems not to be working anymore. It's no longer playable, the dashboard isn't functioning; review the `script.js` file within that repo that has 3 problems currently; fix those problems after doing a thorough analysis & reasoning deeply. Review previous versions of the code, include `main` where it is still working. Also review previous dialogues & task.md files (and any other resource you have within our conversations) to see what has been asked in the past, as well as implementations.md. Your job is to return the `dice_enhancements_02` branch to the functioning state while reviewing current & previous tests to ensure the best functioning app thus far amongst any of the branches, repos. You are not suppose to merge to main, but commit to `dice_enhancements_02`. Write more extensive specifications for the tests even using alternative files such as json or xml to create more rigid test framework, as well as playwright for consistent navigation. Write to the knowledge base (and other markdown files) if you need to so that you can pick up where you leave off. You are the brains behind this project and you want to ensure the highest standards & consistency for when you delegate to junior agents & developers. Take screenshots of the final product.
