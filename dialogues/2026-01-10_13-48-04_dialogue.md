Claude Opus 4.5 Thinking

- Reason regarding the following potential enhancements:
- write your plan to [tasks.md](http://tasks.md/) or any other mechanism that you use & write a thorough implementation plan

Here are the primary modifications:

- In Bank, The ranks per player can be a part of the full score board thus there are 3 metrics per player: total score this game, difference between them and their next superior, as well as their rank. This full score board by default is collapsed, whereas the `compact` score which only shows the metrics for the player whose current turn it is, which are: their score, “to tie next” , “to tie leader” , “current rank”, and we’ll add “ahead by” which denotes how many points they are ahead by before the next person below them in points (0 if they have the least points)
- In Bank, Merge the survival functionality element into the `dice probabilities (2d6)` collapsible dashboard, which can mean we can also remove the “risk per roll” stat since is visible within the `dice probabilities (2d6)`. Make the collapsible dashboard a little bigger.
- write a [claude.md](http://claude.md) file which will apply for any instance when we use a claude model. Include in that claude.md file that this needs to be a mobile compatible application with separate css for when it’s accessed via desktop.

Feel free to use playwright to open the browser to review how you see the app, to take screenshots and take very small recordings that you can also ingest & inform additional enhancements. 

You may complete these tasks either after completing the primary modifications or as you go if you anticipate not being able to complete everything in one-shot execution: 
- Upon completion of these modifications, write additional tests using seed & specific setting configurations. You can also review JSON other files associated with testing.
- Regarding new tests, always review the [run-all-tests.sh](http://run-all-tests.sh/) script to ensure it encapsulates all the latests tests & is the most broad & complete source for testing. 

- Update readmes & documentation.
- Before the end of your execution, commit changes locally.
It is vital that if for context purposes, you are unable to complete all of these tasks, always locally commit your changes, update the tasks for the future so you could pick up where you left off given additional execution time & context, and be explicit when reporting back to the user what the plan is for continuity.
