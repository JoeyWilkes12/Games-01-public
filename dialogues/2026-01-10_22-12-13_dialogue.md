- Reason regarding the following potential enhancements:
- write your plan to [tasks.md](http://tasks.md/) or any other mechanism that you use & write a thorough implementation plan

Here are the primary modifications:

- bank - being your own dice, need a selection panel to input the sum of the two die: (including a doubles) button. The 7 button should be red. This should also have a collapsible view if necessary, but enabled by default. So buttons should be each of the integers 2-12 inclusive, as well as a “doubles” button. There should be a setting that enables “Bring Your Own Die” , but default mode is to roll the die within the user interface.
- The Slidding Puzzle UI format should be a little less tall so that the key, the game, and the buttons can all fit on an iPhone screen without have to scroll. The order and proportions are still good, just needs to be optimized for mobile more.
- In any of the games, if it’s mid game play and the home button is clicked then there should be a confirmation informing the user that current state of the game will be lost and if they’d still like to return to Home Screen (game landing). If the game has no change since its beginning state (as in hasn’t been activated, or had any moves) the no confirmation is necessary.
- In 2048, the dashboard should default to “Definitions” page.

Feel free to use playwright to open the browser to review how you see the app, to take screenshots and take very small recordings that you can also ingest & inform additional enhancements. 

You may complete these tasks either after completing the primary modifications or as you go if you anticipate not being able to complete everything in one-shot execution: 
- Upon completion of these modifications, write additional tests using seed & specific setting configurations. You can also review JSON other files associated with testing.
- Regarding new tests, always review the [run-all-tests.sh](http://run-all-tests.sh/) script to ensure it encapsulates all the latests tests & is the most broad & complete source for testing. 

- Update readmes & documentation.
- Before the end of your execution, commit changes locally.
It is vital that if for context purposes, you are unable to complete all of these tasks, always locally commit your changes, update the tasks for the future so you could pick up where you left off given additional execution time & context, and be explicit when reporting back to the user what the plan is for continuity.
