# Claude Opus 4.5 Thinking
Review the files updated in the last 4 commits of this branch especially the specification markdown files. 
https://github.com/JoeyWilkes12/Games-01-public/commits/v3.4.0/

Reason regarding the specifications and apply to this codebase. 

Feel free to use playwright to open the browser to review how you see the app, to take screenshots and take very small recordings that you can also ingest & inform additional enhancements. Don't forget to start the dev server. 

No need to review markdown files within dialogues folder since those are for git review & not pertinent to running the application. Don't include them in your context ingestion. 

You may complete these tasks either after completing the primary modifications or as you go if you anticipate not being able to complete everything in one-shot execution: 
- Upon completion of these modifications, write additional tests using seed & specific setting configurations. You can also review JSON other files associated with testing.
- Regarding new tests, always review the [run-all-tests.sh](http://run-all-tests.sh/) script to ensure it encapsulates all the latests tests & is the most broad & complete source for testing. 

- Update readmes & documentation.
- Before the end of your execution, commit changes locally.
It is vital that if for context purposes, you are unable to complete all of these tasks, always locally commit your changes, update the tasks for the future so you could pick up where you left off given additional execution time & context, and be explicit when reporting back to the user what the plan is for continuity.
